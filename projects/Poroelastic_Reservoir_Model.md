# Altmann Poroelastic Reservoir Model

## Intro

The analysis of stress path is very important to understand the impact of fluid depletion and injection on the effective stress change in the reservoir. Stress path is the ratio of minimum horizontal stress change to pore pressure change. 

```
Kd = 12 # drained bulk modulus, GPa
Kg = 40 # grain bulk modulus, GPa
G = 5.5 # shear modulus, GPa
Kf = 2 # fluid bulk modulus, GPa
rhof = 1000 # fluid density, kg/m3
poro = 0.167 # porosity of sandstone
kf = 0.1E-6 # hydraulic conductivity, m/s
```
