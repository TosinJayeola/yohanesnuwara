## Welcome to my GitHub Repository!

I'm Yohanes Nuwara. I prefer to call myself as a reservoir analyst, in which I coin the term to tell how I love to integrate two perspectives of geoscience and engineering for oil and gas reservoir analysis. I mostly worked with Python, also partly with MATLAB and R. This is my showcase. I hope you enjoy or find anything useful, and kindly [contact me](https://github.com/yohanesnuwara/yohanesnuwara#-contact-me) if you wish!

About Me

👋 Hi, my name is Yohanes Nuwara. In the meantime, I am working as a reservoir geophysicist. I have B.Sc in Geophysics (2019). I solved problems in Oil and Gas using Python as my main programming language. I am deeply interested in the application of Python to numerical computation for reservoir studies, modeling, and simulation for engineering. I am also interested in machine learning for oil and gas application.
